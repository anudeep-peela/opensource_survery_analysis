## Libraries Used:

## Motivation for the Project

Open source code is a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community.
I wanted to know the quailities of open sourcer contributors and how it would help them in their Jobs.

## Summary of my analysis
From the analysis, it is evident that open source contributors developer are paid better and the programmer who sees the value in code reviews and unit testing are better paid.

## Acknowledgements
I would thank Udacity for guidance and stack overflow for the data
